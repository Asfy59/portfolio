## Selected Academic and Technical Projects

### Multi-Robot Semantic Obstacle Avoidance (Master's Thesis)
**2025**

- Built a ROS2-based multi-robot perception and semantic navigation pipeline for smart-warehouse scenarios.
- Combined mmWave radar fusion, graph-based representations, GNN inference, polygon tracking, and costmap integration.
- Demonstrated low-latency operation (~50 ms sensing-to-costmap) in hardware-in-the-loop trials.
- Stack: ROS2, PyTorch Geometric, Jetson, TI AWR1843, Vicon, C++, Python.

### NeRF Sensor Simulation Pipeline in CARLA
**2024**

- Developed a modular CARLA dataset generation workflow for photorealistic multi-view NeRF training.
- Enabled scalable agent-based scene rendering for synthetic robotics sensor datasets.
- Stack: CARLA, Python, simulation tooling.

### Fingernail Disease Detection via Segmentation and Classification
**2023**

- Curated and labeled an 11k-image hand dataset for segmentation and disease classification.
- Applied semi-supervised segmentation for nail isolation, followed by CNN-based classification.
- Stack: Python, computer vision, deep learning.

### Autonomous UAV Vision and Telemetry Pipeline
**2019**

- Built real-time object detection/classification on embedded hardware for competition UAV deployment.
- Integrated LoRa telemetry for mission-state transmission and operational monitoring.
- Stack: OpenCV, Keras, Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi, LoRa.
