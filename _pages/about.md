I am Muhammad Asfandyar Khan, a robotics and embedded software engineer focused on perception, autonomy, and real-time system integration.

My career is shaped by two themes:
- Building under constraints
- Learning across disciplines and environments

I started in Pakistan, moved through student competition teams and early industry roles in analytics, then returned to hardware and robotics with a master's in Automation and Robotics at TU Dortmund.

Today, I work at the intersection of robotics software, embedded systems, and applied AI.

## What I Bring

- Strong systems thinking across software, sensing, and deployment
- Hands-on integration with ROS2, Jetson, radar, and UAV payload stacks
- Experience operating in startups, corporate teams, and academic research groups
- Clear communication across technical and non-technical stakeholders

## What I Am Looking For

I am currently looking for the next role in robotics/autonomy where I can contribute to:
- Perception and navigation pipelines
- Embedded and edge deployment
- Product-focused engineering with real-world validation
