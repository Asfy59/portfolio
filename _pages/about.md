I am Muhammad Asfandyar Khan, a robotics and embedded software engineer focused on perception, autonomy, and real-time system integration.

My recent work centers on multi-robot perception pipelines using ROS2, mmWave radar, Jetson edge platforms, and graph neural networks for semantic navigation in warehouse-style environments.
