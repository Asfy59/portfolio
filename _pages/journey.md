## A Personal Timeline

### Roots and Early Ambition

I come from a middle-class family in a small town in Pakistan. My career began with one clear goal: build a life through engineering, step by step.

I moved to Karachi for college at DJ Government Science College and adapted to a bigger city, new expectations, and a faster pace of life.

### Engineering Foundation at NUST (2016-2020)

I earned admission opportunities at IBA and NUST, and chose NUST for engineering.

During my bachelor's in electrical engineering, I focused on technical growth and high-pressure team environments:
- Organized social and technical student activities (olympiads, workshops, events)
- Worked in Formula Student team environments and learned discipline through test pressure and deadline constraints
- Joined NUST Airworks and got first deep exposure to machine learning and UAV systems
- Competed in the IMECHE UAS Challenge under difficult field conditions, last-minute iterations, and high stress, ending with a Grand Champion win
- Completed internship experience in instrumentation and controls at Engro Fertilizers
- Built a wall-traversing robot prototype for final-year project work (limited by COVID constraints)

### First Professional Chapter: Analytics and Business Operations (2020-2022)

After graduation, I joined K-Electric through a trainee program:
- First placement in GIS for six months
- Then shifted into data analytics and secured a permanent role
- Built skills in stakeholder management, conflict resolution, BI tooling, and corporate delivery processes

To accelerate learning, I moved to a startup environment with faster execution cycles:
- Worked on operational analytics and feature delivery using Metabase, Tableau, and Monday.com workflows

I later joined an international operations-focused team via SquareTrade/ibex:
- Delivered Python and SQL automation
- Supported operations teams with reporting pipelines, dashboards, and Jira-based request handling

This phase brought early success, but I felt unfinished business with robotics and hardware engineering.

### Germany Transition: Restarting for Robotics (2022 onward)

After resolving finances and visa requirements, I moved to Germany for Automation and Robotics at TU Dortmund.

The transition was demanding:
- New country, language, and bureaucracy
- Living alone while studying after a two-year gap
- Arriving late and catching up academically

I received opportunities in both analytics and engineering, and chose the engineering path:
- Joined Bosch Sensortec and relocated to Reutlingen for embedded sensor validation work
- Returned to Dortmund, focused on coursework and project group work (NeRF dataset generation in CARLA)
- Joined VMT as a working student on tunnel boring machine control simulation, then ended the role to prioritize degree completion
- Focused on language progress and part-time work while finishing remaining courses

### Research Breakthrough and Thesis Work (2025)

At TU Dortmund's Chair of Material Handling, I joined as a student research assistant and built end-to-end robotics systems:
- Multi-robot radar perception and data fusion with ROS2
- GNN-based semantic inference and obstacle representation
- Costmap integration for real-time obstacle-aware planning
- Hardware-in-the-loop validation in multi-robot demonstrations

This work led to a publication at IEEE IECON 2025 and became the foundation of my master's thesis.

### Industry Return in UAV Systems (2025-2026)

Before finishing the thesis, I started a role at HIGHCAT in Konstanz:
- Began remotely, then relocated in January 2026
- Worked on UAV payload control, MAVLink, VISCA, gimbal integration, and edge vision deployment

The company later shifted strategy toward external vendor solutions, reducing the long-term technical growth path. We mutually decided not to extend after the initial six-month phase.

### Current Focus

I am now looking for the next role where I can combine:
- Robotics software and embedded integration
- Practical perception/autonomy engineering
- Team-oriented execution from prototype to field-ready systems
