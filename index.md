## Journey

I come from a middle-class family in a small town in Pakistan. My path has been a series of deliberate moves: from Karachi for college, to NUST for engineering, then through corporate and startup analytics, and finally back to my core ambition in robotics and embedded systems.

The turning point was choosing to restart in Germany with a master's in Automation and Robotics at TU Dortmund. That reset led to Bosch, VMT, research at FLW, an IEEE publication, and UAV autonomy work at HIGHCAT.

## About

I focus on practical engineering that works in the field, not just in demos.

- Robotics software: ROS2 pipelines, perception-to-planning integration
- Embedded systems: Jetson/STM32 bring-up, protocol-level debugging
- Applied AI: GNN and vision models under latency and reliability constraints
- Delivery mindset: cross-functional collaboration and execution under pressure

## Experience Highlights

### TU Dortmund (Student Research Assistant, 2025)
Built a multi-robot radar perception stack with ROS2, graph fusion, and GNN inference; integrated semantic obstacles into navigation costmaps with low end-to-end latency.

### HIGHCAT (Embedded and Vision Software Engineer, 2025-2026)
Integrated UAV payload and localization components; developed MAVLink/VISCA/SimpleBGC control bridges and validated edge tracking on Jetson Orin NX.

### Bosch Sensortec (Intern, 2023)
Built automation and I3C validation tooling for MEMS sensor testing; reduced validation cycle time by ~50%.

### Earlier Chapters (2020-2022)
Worked across K-Electric, Dastagyr, and SquareTrade teams on Python/SQL automation, reporting pipelines, and stakeholder-driven analytics delivery.
