<h2>Journey</h2>
<p>I come from a middle-class family in a small town in Pakistan. My path has been a sequence of high-commitment moves: Karachi for college, NUST for engineering, early analytics roles, and then a return to core robotics through graduate study in Germany.</p>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>I focus on practical engineering that works in field conditions, not just controlled demos.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Robotics software: ROS2 pipelines, perception-to-planning integration</li>
  <li>Embedded systems: Jetson and STM32 bring-up, protocol-level debugging</li>
  <li>Applied AI: GNN and vision models under latency/reliability constraints</li>
  <li>Delivery: cross-functional execution in startups, corporate teams, and research labs</li>

<h2>Experience Highlights</h2>

<h3>TU Dortmund (Student Research Assistant, 2025)</h3>
<p>Built a multi-robot radar perception stack with ROS2, graph fusion, and GNN inference; integrated semantic obstacles into navigation costmaps with low end-to-end latency.</p>

<h3>HIGHCAT (Embedded and Vision Software Engineer, 2025-2026)</h3>
<p>Integrated UAV payload and localization components; developed MAVLink/VISCA/SimpleBGC bridges and validated edge tracking pipelines on Jetson Orin NX.</p>

<h3>Bosch Sensortec (Intern, 2023)</h3>
<p>Developed automation and I3C validation tooling for MEMS sensor testing; reduced validation cycle time by about 50%.</p>
